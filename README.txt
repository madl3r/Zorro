I used custom layers for some collision detection and grounding techniques. Layers don’t export/import through unity packages. I’m resubmitting with only the zip file as the unity packages won’t work with my project.

The levels “WalkingLevel”, “TheGapLevel”, “Elevator Level” and “PlatformingLvl” are the levels that I discussed in my paper. The other two levels included in the package were used for earlier testing.
